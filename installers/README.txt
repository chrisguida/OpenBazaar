In these folders we'll have the scripts necessary to create binary distributions for different operating systems.
The goal here is to have a 1-step build process.

To build the Ubuntu/Debian .deb, enter the ubuntu folder and just execute

$ ./build

the end result should be the .deb binary installer for Ubuntu/Debian based distros
(and possibly an .rpm installer as well)
